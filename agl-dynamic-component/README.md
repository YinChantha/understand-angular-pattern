# AglDynamicComponent

This project was generated to understand about angular-form using version 20.3.16.

## This project I aim to understand how is dynamic component works instead of routes 

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
nvm use // will set up using node 20.3.16
npm install // install depencies
ng serve // to start local development
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
